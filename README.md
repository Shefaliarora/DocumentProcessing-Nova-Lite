# DocumentProcessing-Nova-Lite

I built a fully serverless AI-based document understanding pipeline that:
ðŸ“„ Extracts unstructured text from invoices using Amazon Textract
ðŸ§  Uses Amazon Nova Lite (via Bedrock) to intelligently convert raw text into structured JSON
ðŸ“¥ Automatically validates and stores that data into Amazon DynamoDB
ðŸ“Š Making it ready for downstream analytics via Athena or QuickSight!

This use case is a great starting point for:
âœ… Automating invoice processing
âœ… Resume parsing
âœ… Legal contract understanding
âœ… Or any scenario where structured data is trapped in unstructured documents

ðŸ’¡ Built entirely with AWS managed services â€” no infrastructure to manage, highly scalable, and production-ready.
